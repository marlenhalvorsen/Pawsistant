Pawsistant is a full-stack web application built with Blazor WebAssembly (frontend) and ASP.NET Core (backend), designed to help dog owners get personalized training tips through AI-powered chat.

The backend follows a clean architecture using controller–service–repository patterns, with JWT-based authentication and lightweight data persistence using Entity Framework Core.

Models are shared between frontend and backend through a shared library to ensure consistency and type safety across the stack.
